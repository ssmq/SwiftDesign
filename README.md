# SwiftDesign
SwiftDesign is an adaptable app for creating and managing custom UIs. Features include web views, PDF handling, image viewing, HTML editing, and serial data transmission via Bluetooth. Customizable buttons and startup options enhance user experience.
Bluetooth Serial Interface to Send data to microcontrollers
SwiftDesign can control programmable Bluetooth LED strips like WS2812B
SwiftDesign offers object-oriented programmable buttons (40 in total) and 10 sliders with serial Bluetooth transmission capabilities. Create and summon custom menus, build and manage PDF libraries, edit HTML files, and turn them into libraries for further use.

Rangmang Project
Rangmang is a project designed to control RGB LED strips via Bluetooth serial commands using SwiftDesign. This project allows users to program and control WS2812B LED strips to create stunning lighting effects. SwiftDesign acts as the interface to send commands to the microcontrollers, enabling dynamic color changes and patterns.
